                I'm <b>Keegan</b>, but you know me as Rhet0r1cal_. I'm 16 years of age, and have sold my soul to the world of computers never to return. I've been using computers for about 7 years, and have been coding stuff since early 2017. My main skill is <span className = 'special-text'>web development</span>, and i've been focusing on that since early 2020. <br></br><br></br> Starting on platforms such as Scratch, I made around 50+ things <i>(thank god they're gone)</i>, before simply deciding that letters and numbers could do so much more then blocks and legos. Ever since that point, i've been using my keyboard as if it were a sport, have somehow accumulated a WPM of 100+, and have even starting building computers. <br></br><br></br> I look forward to working with you. üòÅ
