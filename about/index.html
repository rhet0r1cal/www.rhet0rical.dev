      I'm <b>Keegan</b>, but you know me as Rhet0r1cal_. I'm 16 years of age, and have sold my soul to the world of computers never to return. I've been using computers for about 7 years, and have been coding stuff since early 2017. My main skill is <span class = 'special-text'>web development</span>, and i've been focusing on that since early 2020. <br><br>Starting on platforms such as <a href = 'https://scratch.mit.edu/'>Scratch</a>, I made around 50+ things <i>(thank god they're gone)</i>, before simply deciding that letters and numbers could do so much more then blocks and legos. Ever since that point, i've been using my keyboard as if it were a sport, have somehow accumulated a WPM of 100+, and have even starting building computers. <br><br> I look forward to working with you. 😁
